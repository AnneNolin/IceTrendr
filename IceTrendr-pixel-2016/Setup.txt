============================================

visualization and interpretation of image time series

1) Note this website code uses google-earth plugin which is now deprecated for all browsers. We are working on a more stable and robust plotform. If you want to try, please use GoogleEarthPluginSetup.exe, which have been tested on FireFox on Windows7.

2) Will require (Adobe) flex installed on server. Adobe flex (or ApacheFlex) will handle client application to interact with timesync database. You can download ApacheFlex at: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=34016162
   or
   https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLEX/Installation+help

Within the flex directory, update the following two lines in timesyncv2.mxml to match your local settings.

	private var gateway:String = "gateway21.php";
	private var server:String = "localhost";

2a) To compile and generate an adobe swift file use mxmlc.

3) In the services directory contain all the php which handles the business logic for communication with timesync database.  Please update the following lines in baseservice.php to match your local settings. 

	protected $username = "User Name Here";
	protected $password = "Password HERE";
	protected $server = "Database Server";
	protected $port = "Database Port";	(This is usually 3306)
	protected $databasename = "Default Database"; 	(Name of SQL database. For example: IceTrendrPixel)


4) Will also require installation of SQL for handling image database. Within the sql directory is DDL for IceTrendr (timesync) database
